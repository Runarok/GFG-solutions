For her&nbsp;undergraduation studies she joins an engineering college GIT,&nbsp;Geekland Institute of Technology. The college has a&nbsp;semester wise system, a&nbsp;semester being of&nbsp;<strong>K</strong>&nbsp;days.&nbsp;Before her&nbsp;first day for the college Siri&nbsp;and her mom went to market for shopping and bought <strong>N</strong> dresses. Her mom&nbsp;told her that every<strong> M<sup>th</sup></strong> day&nbsp;she will bring her a new dress, but since the shops&nbsp;in the Geekland are open only in the evening, so Siri could only wear her new dress the next day. If on a particular day Siri didn't had a new dress to wear,&nbsp;she&nbsp;bunks&nbsp;that day off the college. Help&nbsp;Siri to know for how many days she will bunk her classes in a semester of <strong>K</strong>&nbsp;days.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Example 1:</strong></span></p>

<pre><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Input</strong>: N = 9, M = 3, K = 15
<strong>Output:</strong>&nbsp;
2
<strong>Explanation</strong>: For first 9 days Siri has new  
dresses and she will wear them for 9 days, 
during these 9 days she will get 3 more dresses
so she will wear them on 10<sup>th</sup>, 11<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> day.
On 12<sup>th</sup> day she will get one more new dress to 
wear on 13<sup>th</sup> day. On 15<sup>th</sup> day she will get one 
more new dress but she can't wear it before 16<sup>th</sup>
day. For 14<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup> day she does not have any
new dress, so she will bunk two days.</span>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Your Task:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br>
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function <strong>bunkDays()&nbsp;</strong>which takes integers <strong>N</strong>, <strong>M</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>K</strong>&nbsp;as input parameters and returns the number of days Siri will bunk her classes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Constraints:</strong><br>
1 ≤ N, M, K ≤&nbsp;1000</span></p>
