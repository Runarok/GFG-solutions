I</span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">n each round:&nbsp;<br></span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; - The 1st player plays against the 2nd player, the 3rd player plays against the 4th, and so on.<br></span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; - The player with the higher rating wins the match and moves to the next round.<br></span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; - If there is an odd number of players, the last player automatically moves to the next round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Your task is to determine how many matches each player wins during the tournament. Store the result for each player in an <strong>answer[]</strong> array and return it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Note: The tournament continues until only one player remains.</span></p>

<pre><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Input</strong><strong>: </strong>arr[] = {7, 1, 5, 3, 9}
<strong>Output</strong><strong>: </strong>3 1 2 1 1
<strong>Explanation</strong><strong>: </strong>players: 7 1 5 3 9, The first round: (7 has a match with 1), (5 has a match with 3), (9 has no matches automatically qualifies)
players: 7 5 9 The second round: (7 has a match with 5), (9 has no matches automatically qualifies)
