But he can't reach&nbsp;the&nbsp;kitchen shelf&nbsp;which has&nbsp;<strong>'N'</strong> chocolates. His family has K members and he can&nbsp;call any number of family members to help him out. After acquiring the chocolates, the family members that Geek called&nbsp;will first divide the chocolates amongst themsleves equally. They do this in such a way that they all get maximum number of chocolates. The remaining chocolates are given to Geek.&nbsp;<br>
Find the maximum number of chocolates that Geek can get.</span></p>

<p><br>
<strong><span style="font-size:18px">Example 1:</span></strong></p>

<pre><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Input:</strong> 
N = 15, K = 4
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explaination:</strong> 
Calling 1 member. Geek will get nothing. 
Calling 2 members. Geek will get 1 chocolate. 
Calling 3 members. Geek will get nothing. 
Calling 4 members. Geek will get 3 chocolates. </span></pre>

<p><br>
<strong><span style="font-size:18px">Example 2:</span></strong></p>

<pre><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Input:</strong> 
N = 19, K = 5
<strong>Output:</strong> 4
<strong>Explaination:</strong> 5 memebers will be called who will 
divide 15 chocolates among them. And 4 chocolates 
will be left for Geek. </span></pre>

<p><br>
<span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Your Task:</strong><br>
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function <strong>maxChocolate()</strong> which takes&nbsp;N and K as input parameters and returns the maximum number of chocolates Geek can have.</span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Expected Time Complexity:</strong> O(min(N,K))<br>
<strong>Expected Auxiliary Space:</strong> O(1)</span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Constraints:</strong><br>
1 ≤ N, K ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
