Some of them are connected via bidirectional railway tracks.<br>
There are railway tracks 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, and so on.<br>
There are railway tracks between every two consecutive odd numbers. 1-3, 3-5, 5-7, 7-9, and so on.<br>
There are railway tracks between every two consecutive even numbers. 2-4, 4-6, 6-8, 8-10, and so on.<br>
Given two cities a and b, check if there is a railway track between them or not.</span></p>

<span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Example 1:</strong></span></p>

<pre><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Input: </strong>
a = 1, b = 4
<strong>Output:</strong> NO
<strong>Explaination:</strong> There is no direct track 
between 1 and 4.</span></pre>

<p><br>
<span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Example 2:</strong></span></p>

<pre><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Input: </strong>
a = 4, b = 3
<strong>Output:</strong> YES
<strong>Explaination: </strong>There is a direct track 
between 3 and 4.</span></pre>

<p><br>
<span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Your Task:</strong><br>
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function <strong>isConnected()</strong> which takes a and b as input parameters and returns 1 if there is a direct connection, otherwise, returns 0.<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> The generated output is YES when you return 1 and NO when you return 0.</span></p>

<strong>Expected Auxiliary Space: </strong>O(1)</span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Constraints:</strong><br>
