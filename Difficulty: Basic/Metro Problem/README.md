It Stops at each station for 1 sec (neglect the time of station switching). A Guy daily waits at station number 11 for the train. Given <strong>n </strong>i,e current station no. at which metro is and its direction <strong>c</strong>, find the time he has to wait to catch up the train.<br>
<br>
<strong>Example 1:</strong></span></p>

<pre><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Input:  </strong>n = 0, c = U
<strong>Output: </strong>11
<strong>Explanation: </strong>Since train is at station number 
0, so the guy has to wait 11 sec.</span>
</pre>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Example 2:</strong></span></p>

<pre><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Input: </strong>n = 12, c = D
<strong>Output: </strong>1
<strong>Explanation: </strong>Since train is at station number
12 and its direction is down it means the guy
has to wait for only 1 sec.</span>
</pre>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Your Task:</strong><br>
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function&nbsp;<strong>waiting_time()</strong>&nbsp;which takes n and c as input parameter and returns the time for which the guy has to wait.</span><br>
